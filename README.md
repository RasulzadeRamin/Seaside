# Seaside - Unity Project
This is a personal Unity project that features a seaside scene with a basic third-person character controller, various interactive elements, and custom shaders. The project integrates models and textures generated from Blender using geometry nodes and employs various animations to enhance the experience.

## Features
1. Third-Person Character Controller
  - The character is controlled using Unity's new Input System.
  - Basic movement (walking/running) and camera control are integrated using Unity's own Starter Assets.
  - Interaction with objects such as doors and sitting is implemented.
  - Imported animations for walking, sitting, and interacting with the environment.
2. Interactive Elements
  - Door Interaction: Doors can be opened and closed using keyboard interaction (E key). When the character exits the trigger zone, the door automatically closes.
  - Sitting Interaction: The character can sit on specific objects. If the player attempts to sit in an invalid area, a UI prompt will notify them.
3. Seaside Environment
  - Custom water shader created using Unity's Shader Graph for dynamic and stylized water effects.
  - Sand, rocks, and other seaside elements to create a realistic environment.
4. House Models
  - House models with variable textures and materials are used to add variety.
  - Models are created in Blender using geometry nodes and imported as .fbx files into Unity.
5. Animations
  - Character animations for walking, sitting, interacting with doors, and other actions are imported and integrated with Unity's Animator.

# Installation & Setup
Requirements
Unity: This project is built using Unity 2021.3 or higher.
Blender (Optional): Models are generated using Blender Geometry Nodes, although Blender is not required to run the project.
TextMesh Pro: Ensure you have TextMesh Pro installed via the Unity Package Manager for UI-related functionality.
Steps to Run the Project:
## Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/RasulzadeRamin/Seaside.git```

Open the project in Unity 2023.2.20f1.
Ensure that the following packages are installed:
1. Input System
2. TextMesh Pro
3. Open the **Assets > Scenes > Seaside** Unity Scene
3. Hit Play in the Unity Editor to explore the scene.
## Controls
Movement: WASD or arrow keys to move the character.
Camera Control: Use the mouse to rotate the camera.
Interact with Doors: Press E when near a door to open or close it.
Sit: Press Q near a sitting area. If youâ€™re not in a sitting area, a UI message will display "Not a sitting place!"
Models and Assets
## Assets 
1. Character: The basic character model is from the Unity Asset Store or customized for this project.

2. Houses: Blender-generated .fbx models with procedural textures applied in Unity.

3. Terrain and Water

4. Boat on the water surface
